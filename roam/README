To use the ROAM gridmap callout you need to have the following line in your
/etc/grid-security/gsi-authz.conf file:

globus_mapping /usr/local/fusiongrid/lib/libRoam roam_gridmap_callout

When the jobmanager checks to see if a users credentials map to a local account it will
first check with ROAM and if it does not find a mapping in ROAM it will look in the normal
globus gridmap file. When the jobmanager checks with ROAM it uses the check_access_jobmanager.fun
tdi function. A default version of this is provided which will check the user for site Access
permission and for job Execute permission. The following environment variables determine the behavior:

ROAM_SERVER --- specifies the roam host (i.e. roam.fusiongrid.org)
ROAM_SITE_RESOURCE --- specifies the site resource (optional)
ROAM_JOBMANAGER_RESOURCE --- specifies the jobmanager resource

The resource permissions are checked as follows:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if the ROAM_SITE_RESOURCE is defined then the following must be true to enable the user to execute jobs:

   1) The user "nobody" was not granted "Access" permission to the site resource
   2) This user was not granted "Noaccess" permission to the site resource
   3) Either the user "everyone" or this user has been granted the "Access" permission to the site resource

if the ROAM_SITE_RESOURCE was not defined or the above rules were obeyed then the following must also be
true to enable the user to execute jobs:

   1) The user "nobody" was not granted the "Execute" permission to the jobmanager resource
   2) This user was granted the "Execute" permission to the jobmanager resource and the aux information
      for this permission contains a valid local username. (The job will be run using this username)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The gridftp server will use a similar procedure for determining access as the jobmanager. This is controlled
by th check_access_file.fun tdi function. The only differences between the gridftp and jobmanager access
checking is that gridftp uses the "ROAM_GRIDFTP_RESOURCE" environment variable and for that resource it checks
for the "Access" permission instead of the "Execute" permission.

You can override this access check logic by putting a site specific tdi directory in the MDS_PATH search list
and create your own check_access_jobmanager.fun and check_access_file.fun procedures.
